    <label for="q1">1. What is Cahoot?</label>
    <p>Cahoot is a peer-to-peer platform that allows shoppers to buy goods from overseas with the help of travellers.
<br/><br/>Shoppers simply have to make a request for the item on our app and travellers who are travelling to that particular country can help to take up the request for a tip.
<br/><br/>To safeguard the interest of both parties, we have included a feature called Cahoot Guarantee, which ensures that the traveller purchases the item only after the shopper has deposited the money with us, and the money is only transferred to the traveller only after the shopper receiving the product.
<br/><br/>We aim to provide a safe and trusted environment for people to shop and travel. With Cahoot, you can shop with no boundaries and travel with no limitations.
</p>
</section>
    <section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q2">
    <label for="q2">2. How do I submit a shopping request? (Shopper)</label>
    <p>Tap into our network of travellers to get something you want from overseas in just 3 simple steps!
<br/><br/>1.	Post your item request (include as many details as possible) on Cahoot, and we will do our magic to match you with a traveller who is willing to take up that job.
<br/>2.	After confirmation with the traveller, transfer the money into our escrow account which we will safeguard for you till you have received the item.
<br/>3.	When the traveller returns, collect your item directly from the traveller at the agreed location or at our collection centre.
</p>
</section>
    <section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q3">
    <label for="q3">3. How can I earn money on Cahoot? (Traveller)</label>
    <p>Help a shopper get something overseas and earn extra money on-the-go!
<br/><br/>1.	Input your travel itinerary onto Cahoot. You will receive auto-notifications of potential jobs based on your travelling destination.
<br/>2.	Check out the shopper (and item requested) and offer to take up the job!
<br/>3.	Once the shopper has made payment with us, you can proceed to help purchase the item.
<br/>4.	Meet up and deliver the item to the shopper at the agreed location or simply deposit it at our collection centre. Money will be transferred to your account after a successful transaction!
</p>

<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q4">
    <label for="q4">4. How much should I, as a traveller, offer when taking up a shopping request?</label>
    <p>Travellers should have a rough gauge of the cost of the item he/she will be able to get. If you are not sure, you can always make your offer after having checked out the price of the item at the overseas store.
<br/><br/>The excess of the offer price less the cost of the item will get to go to your pockets! However, please do take note of import tax duties and tax refunds (if available) when considering the offer price.
<br/><br/>Travellers are the ones who will submit the offer price (in this case the lower the offer price, the higher the chance of getting the job!) for a shopping request. If negotiations should take place, the traveller can then edit the offer price before confirmation.
</p>
</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q5">
    <label for="a5">5. How can I edit or cancel a shopping request?</label>
    <p>Unfortunately, our app does not allow edits or cancellations for shopping requests at the moment but we are working on it to be available really soon.
<br/><br/>If you would like to make changes in the mean time, please post a new request.
</p>
</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q6">
    <label for="q6">6. How can I edit or cancel a trip?</label>
    <p>In the case where your trip is changed or cancelled, you may delete your itinerary under the ‘Profile’ tab and submit a new one if needed.</p>
</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q7">
    <label for="q7">7. What are the fees for Cahoot?</label>
    <p>Shoppers: Cahoot charges an administrative fee of 7% on top of the offer price to cover transaction charges on our payment gateway partner, PayPal, and for our employees to have coffee while working hard for you.
<br/><br/>Travellers: We highly recommend travellers to opt for bank transfer as their payout method. This is both FREE and convenient. However, if you prefer to receive the payout via Paypal, do note that 7% of the offer price will be deducted from your payout amount to cover transaction charges.
<br/><br/>For more details on PayPal charges, please click here. (https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees)
</p>
</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q8">
    <label for="q8">8. What does Cahoot Guarantee means?</label>
    <p>Cahoot Guarantee protects you by holding your payment in escrow until you have received your requested item and acknowledged that it has been delivered to you in satisfactory condition.
<br/><br/>Cahoot Guarantee lasts for a period of seven days after the traveller has indicated that the item has been delivered to you. If your item is received in unsatisfactory condition or does not match your request description, you will have seven days to raise the issue with us.
<br/><br/>You should reach out to your traveller to resolve the issue firsthand. Some issues are best resolved with direct communication between shopper and traveller. You can contact your traveller via Cahoot’s in-app messenger. All communication on Cahoot’s platform are recorded and used to assist us in resolving any issues.
<br/><br/>If there are no issues raised during the Cahoot Guarantee period, the shopper will be deemed to have received the requested item in satisfactory condition.
</p>
</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q9">
    <label for="q9">9. Can I exchange or return my items?</label>
    <p>Many retailers offer returns and exchanges upon certain conditions. Do check the retailers’ website for such conditions. As Cahoot is a platform, we do not hold inventory and thus do not do returns or exchanges. A little suggestion, make sure you input as much details as possible in the request so that the traveller can get the correct item  for you!

<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q10">
    <label for="q10">10. Controlled and Prohibited Goods Policy</label>
    <p>Each country has its own regulations regarding controlled and prohibited goods. A rule of thumb, do check out the governments’ website for such information before requesting for exotic goods (especially if you might be planning on having a pet dragon).

<br/><br/>Violations of this Controlled and Prohibited Goods Policy may subject users to a range of adverse actions, including but not limited to:
<br/><br/>-	Listing deletion
<br/>-	Limits placed on account privileges
<br/>-	Account suspension and termination
<br/>-	Legal actions
<br/><br/>Singapore’s controlled and prohibited goods can be found here.

</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q11">
    <label for="q11">11. Import tax duties</label>
    <p>Each country has its own tax laws regarding import tax duties. Travellers carrying goods for shoppers back to Singapore are not eligible for GST relief. Travellers are required to declare and pay the GST for the goods at the Custom Tax Payment Office or at the Self-Service Tax Payment Kiosk at the checkpoints.
<br/><br/>For more information on GST relief, please click here.

<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q12">
    <label for="q12">12. Tax refunds</label>
    <p>We at Cahoot place much emphasis on paying lesser for the same item. That is why we strongly encourage travellers to apply for tax refunds before leaving the originating country. If you love the free economy as much as we do, pass on the love (tax savings) to the shopper by bidding for an even lower amount when tax refunds are considered.
</p>
</section>
<section class="faq-section faqcenter">
    <input type="checkbox" id="q13">
    <label for="q13">13. When can I raise a dispute case?</label>
    <p>Here are some possible scenarios:
<br/><br/>-	You received a damaged item
<br/>-	You bought an original but received a counterfeit
<br/>-	You received a completely different item
